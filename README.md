# Drift
The goal goal of this project is to create a playable Action Adventure RPG style game in Unreal with multiplayer aspects using the Gameplay Ability System (GAS).
For more info on the Game design/Story visit the Milanote board for [Drift](https://app.milanote.com/1Lo7yz1CtfdMcA/drift).

I will be learning multiple skills along the way and hope to document my process and the resources I used to solve issues.
This is project is heavily based on [tranek's GASDocumentation ](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation) and [Epic's guided tour of Gameplay Abilities](https://forums.unrealengine.com/t/inside-unreal-a-guided-tour-of-gameplay-abilities/156078).
To start, I have run through Tranek's code line by line along with Epics documentation of the system in order to get a grip on the basics of GAS and will iterate from there to create my own authentic game.
